// Package catalog is the built-in directory of personas amq-squad understands.
// It's intentionally small and Go-native so a new persona is one code change
// plus a rebuild, not a config file users have to discover.

// Role is one persona entry in the catalog. Field semantics:
//

//	PreferredBinary  "claude" or "codex", user can override at team init time
//	Profile          short market-listing copy shown in interactive setup
//	Description      one-line summary seeded into role.md
//	Skills           slash commands worth invoking in this role's priming
//	DefaultPeers     persona IDs this archetype usually talks to
