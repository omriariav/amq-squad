// Package state provides a reusable, fast, read-only session-discovery and
// per-agent liveness foundation shared by the `status` board and the upcoming
// Mission Control console.
//
// The package is pure stdlib (os, os/exec, encoding/json, path/filepath, time,
// strings). It deliberately does NOT import internal/cli to avoid an import
// cycle; the status / Mission Control surfaces live there and will consume this
// package, not the other way around. It MAY reuse internal/launch scanners.
//
// Two perf/correctness rules drive the design:
//
//   - DISCOVERY shells out at most ONCE for the AMQ base root (the caller is
//     expected to resolve it and pass it in). Sessions and per-agent dirs are
//     then found by SCANNING THE FILESYSTEM under that base root, reusing the
//     existing launch.ScanRestorableEntriesInRoot globbing. The historical
//     landmine — running `amq env` once per member during classification — is
//     eliminated: Snapshot never execs `amq`.
//
//   - LIVENESS is COMPUTED, never read from presence.status (which lies: a
//     running agent can show "offline" and a long-dead agent can show
//     "active"). The algorithm mirrors the canonical liveness already in the
//     repo (internal/cli/preflight.go presenceFreshness + PID-liveness probe,
//     internal/cli/list.go looksActive / wakeHealthForEntry).
