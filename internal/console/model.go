// Package console implements the read-only Mission Control TUI for amq-squad.
//
// SCAFFOLD PHASE: this package stands up the Bubble Tea root Model, the
// fsnotify-backed watcher, the snapshot-rebuild update flow, and the
// non-interactive (--once) static board. The INTERACTIVE VIEWS (the routed
// session/thread/timeline panes and key handling beyond quit) arrive in the
// next phase.
//
// Architectural invariants this package upholds:
//
//   - internal/state stays stdlib-only. This package is the ONLY place that
//     imports bubbletea / bubbles / lipgloss / fsnotify; the read-only state
//     model never learns about the TUI.
//
//   - The Model holds the *state.Snapshot as an IMMUTABLE value. No view reads
//     the filesystem; no goroutine mutates the Model. The data flow is strictly
//     one-directional: a filesystem event -> a debounced rebuild Cmd -> a goroutine
//     runs state.Build -> a tea.Msg carries a FRESH snapshot back -> Update
//     replaces the held snapshot -> the next render reads only that value.
//
//   - The full-screen program renders to /dev/tty, never os.Stdout, so the
//     stdout-purity contract the other verbs' tests assert stays intact. The
//     --once path is the sole exception: it writes ONE static board to the
//     supplied writer (stdout) and never starts a tea.Program.
